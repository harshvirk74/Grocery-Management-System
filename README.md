# Grocery Store Management Database System

This project was all about building a solid database system for "Everyday Essentials," a grocery store. The main idea was to move them off old Excel files and onto a proper database to make managing employees and inventory much more efficient.

## Project Overview

I developed this database to really smooth out their operations. It helps them keep track of everything from employees and departments to all their inventory. This system is a reliable way to pull data for analysis, like checking item quantities, prices, profit margins, and even tracking changes in stock.

## What I Built & Used

* **Database Design:** Designed a relational database following 3rd Normal Form (3NF). It has over 5 interconnected tables covering employees, jobs, departments, items, stock logs, and suppliers.
* **Data Integrity & Automation:** Put in place:
    * **Triggers:** These automatically logged stock updates and stopped pricing errors, keeping the data clean.
    * **Indexes:** Optimized these to make queries run much faster and get data back efficiently.
    * **Stored Procedures, Functions, & Transactions:** Used these for more advanced data handling and to automate tasks.
* **Data Analysis & Reporting:** Created **views and queries** (including inner/outer joins and subqueries) for in-depth data analysis and reporting.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Automated **backups** and **data imports** (from CSV files), plus set up text reports using SQL Server Agent and batch files.

## Skills I Used

* **Database Design & Implementation:** Hands-on with relational database modeling (ERD, 3NF).
* **SQL Development:** Wrote complex queries, stored procedures, functions, triggers, and managed transactions.
* **Data Management:** Focused on data accuracy, performance optimization, and automating data tasks.
* **Data Analysis:** Developed tools to get useful business insights from the data.
* **Problem-Solving:** Solved real business needs by building out this database system.
